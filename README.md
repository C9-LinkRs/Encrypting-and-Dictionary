#(Java) Encrypting/Dictionary-and-Translator
It's a encryting and dictionary program, it's my final lab of 2nd semester, did it with a classmate (credit for him).
Basically you can add words and consult it meaning, also you can add it traduction, it can be english to spanish or viceverce.
The traduction can be encrypted with Vigenere algorithm's and them the result of that is back encrypted with a modified Vigenere algorithm's maked
by my classmate and me, finally you can translate the encryted traduction to binary code.
